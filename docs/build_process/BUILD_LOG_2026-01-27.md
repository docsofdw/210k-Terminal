A new script to sync company financial data from the 210k Capital Google Sheet.

**Features:**
- Pulls BTC holdings, shares outstanding, debt, cash, and preferreds
- Maps sheet column headers to database tickers
- Uses Google Service Account authentication
- Added `npm run db:sync` command

**Synced Fields:**
```typescript
{
  btcHoldings: number
  sharesOutstanding: number
  debtUsd: number
  cashUsd: number
  preferredsUsd: number
}
```

## 2. Comps Table Filtering

### Updated: `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/comps/_components/comps-table.tsx`

Added interactive filtering to the main comps table.

**Features:**
- Search by ticker or company name
- Filter by exchange dropdown
- Filter by currency dropdown
- Shows "X of Y companies" count
- Clear button when filters active
- Filters derived dynamically from actual company data

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Filter state
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("")
const [exchangeFilter, setExchangeFilter] = useState<string>("all")
const [currencyFilter, setCurrencyFilter] = useState<string>("all")

// Dynamic filter options
const filterOptions = useMemo(() => {
  const exchanges = [...new Set(companies.map(c => c.exchange))].sort()
  const currencies = [...new Set(companies.map(c => c.tradingCurrency))].sort()
  return { exchanges, currencies }
}, [companies])
```

**Note:** Sorting was already implemented - click column headers to sort.

## 3. Charts Date Range Selector

### Created: `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/charts/_components/date-range-selector.tsx`

Added date range buttons to the charts page.

**Options:**
- 7D, 30D, 90D (default), 1Y, ALL
- Uses URL params for persistence (`?days=30`)
- Styled with terminal orange for active state

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const DATE_RANGES = [
  { label: "7D", days: 7 },
  { label: "30D", days: 30 },
  { label: "90D", days: 90 },
  { label: "1Y", days: 365 },
  { label: "ALL", days: 0 }  // 0 = fetch all available data
]
```

**Commit:** `b22551b` - Add comps table filtering and chart date range selector

## 4. Data Integrity Verification

### Analysis Performed

Compared mNAV calculations between app and Google Sheet to verify formula correctness.

**Results:**
| Company | Sheet mNAV | Calc mNAV | Status |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------|
| MATA.V | 0.24x | 0.20x | OK |
| ALCPB.PA | 1.08x | 1.03x | OK |
| 3350.T | 1.23x | 1.54x | Timing diff |
| LQWD.V | 0.93x | 1.09x | Timing diff |
| 1723.HK | 19.36x | 19.72x | Timing diff |
| SWC.AQ | 2.26x | 0.70x | Price source diff |

**Findings:**
- Calculation formulas are correct
- Differences due to timing and data source variations:
  - BTC price: Sheet $87,498 vs DB $89,357
  - Stock prices may differ between Yahoo and sheet sources
- No bugs in mNAV, EV, or BTC NAV calculations

## 5. FX Rates from Database

### Updated: `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/comps/page.tsx`

Fixed hardcoded FX rates to use database values.

**Before:**
```typescript
// Placeholder FX rates (will be fetched from DB in production)
const fxRates = new Map<string, number>([
  ["CAD", 1.35],
  ["JPY", 150],
  // ... hardcoded values
])
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [companies, btcPriceData, stockPricesMap, fxRatesMap] = await Promise.all([
  getAllCompanies(),
  getLatestBtcPrice(),
  getLatestStockPrices(),
  getLatestFxRates()  // Now fetches from DB
])

// Convert with fallbacks for missing currencies
const fxRates = new Map<string, number>()
for (const [currency, fallback] of Object.entries(defaultRates)) {
  const dbRate = fxRatesMap.get(currency)
  fxRates.set(currency, dbRate ? Number(dbRate.rateToUsd) : fallback)
}
```

### Updated: `lib/api/fx-rates.ts`

Added missing currencies for international markets.

**Before:**
```typescript
export const SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES = ["USD", "CAD", "EUR", "GBP", "JPY", "HKD", "AUD"]
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES = [
  "USD", "CAD", "EUR", "GBP", "JPY", "HKD", "AUD",
  "BRL", "THB", "KRW"  // Brazil, Thailand, South Korea
]
```

## 6. Cron Job Schedule Updates

### Updated: `vercel.json`

Optimized cron schedules for global market coverage.

**Stock Prices:**
```json
// Before: Only covered European hours

// After: Covers all global markets
"schedule": "*/15 * * * 1-5"
```

**FX Rates:**
```json
// Before: Once daily
"schedule": "0 6 * * *"

// After: Every 4 hours
"schedule": "0 */4 * * *"
```

**Market Hours Coverage:**

|--------|-----------|---------|
| Asia/Pacific | 0-9 | Tokyo, KOSDAQ, HKEX, SET, ASX |
| Europe | 7-17 | Hamburg, LSE, Aquis, Euronext |
| Americas | 13-21 | B3, NASDAQ, TSX-V |

### Updated: `lib/api/yahoo-finance.ts`

Fixed yahoo-finance2 v3.x API instantiation.

**Before:**
```typescript

```

import YahooFinance from "yahoo-finance2"
const yahooFinance = new YahooFinance({ suppressNotices: ["yahooSurvey"] })
```
